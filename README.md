# task-5
In the AI & ML Internship, the focus is on learning tree-based models, specifically **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**, using a classification dataset such as the **Heart Disease Dataset**. The task involves training a decision tree classifier, visualizing the tree, and analyzing overfitting by controlling the depth of the tree. It also includes training a random forest model to compare its performance with a single tree and interpreting **feature importances**. Additionally, the task emphasizes the use of **cross-validation** to evaluate model performance more reliably.
